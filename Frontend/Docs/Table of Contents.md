**TO DO**: Update this information to match the new front end.

[//]: # (You have to specify exactly what element the application gets attached to, this is done in your implementation setup by assigning to `document.body.onload`)
[//]: # (The player application now automatically fills its parent element anyway)
[//]: # (Custom UI is now done using Overlays, or by modifying the base application)
[//]: # (This should go into a different page, perhaps the contents)
We recommend using the default player page as a starting point for creating your own custom player page. You'll find this page at `PixelStreamingInfrastructure\SignallingWebServer\Public\player.html` under your Unreal Engine installation folder. Then, use the information on this page to learn how to extend your page and tie it in with your Project's gameplay logic.

Additionally, if you have cloned the Pixel Streaming Infrastructure repository and made upstream changes, you can fork the repo and make a pull request.
