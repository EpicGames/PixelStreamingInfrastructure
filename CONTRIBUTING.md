# Welcome to Pixel Streaming contribution guide

First and foremost, thank you for your time and contribution to Pixel Streaming!<br/> We are proud and excited to be a part of a passionate community who continuously help improve Pixel Streaming ðŸŽ‰

If you are not familiar with contributing on GitHub, have a look at the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/get-started) to learn more about repositories structure, forks, branches, commits, issues, and PRs.

### Code of conduct

Please remain patient, courteous and professional at all times. Any form of spam, abuse or discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Getting started

### Creating issues

If you have encountered a bug, have suggestions for our documentation, or would ike to propose a feature that could achievably enhance Pixel Streaming in various use case scenarios, you can raise this with us by creating a new issue.
1. First, search all open and closed issues [here](https://github.com/EpicGames/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) - your issue may have already been discussed or addressed.
2. If your issue doesn't exist, open a new issue [here](https://github.com/EpicGames/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/issues/new/choose) by selecting a bug or feature request.
3. Make sure to fill in the template as much as possible - any information you can provide, such as repro steps, crash stacks, screenshots, etc. can help us triage and fix the problem as quickly as possible.
4. Keep an eye on the status of your issue - our developers or other users might reach out with requests for more information. If this happens, issues that have not received response in over 30 days will be automatically closed.
5. Be patient while waiting on a resolution - we prioritize the issues internally, and some less critical features (however much we'd love to implement them!) will take a backseat to more pressing priorities, so some issue can take a while to get implemented.

### Creating pull requests (PR)

If you have a solution to a problem you've encountered or to any other open issue, you can create a pull request with your changes.
1. Fork the repo.
2. Branch off of the `main` branch in your fork.
3. Do as much testing as you can, and when you are happy, commit the update.
4. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/EpicGames/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/pulls) and don't forget to link it to an issue if there's an existing one. Add as much information as possible to your PR - describe the problem your change solves, mention any testing you have done and attach any relevant documents and screenshots.
5. If your PR is good to go, we will merge it in. Woohoo! We thank you for your time and efforts!
6. Keep a close eye on your PR - quite often, our developers will review your PR and leave comments; we might request some minor code changes and modifications, style unification, or leave any general comments and questions that are preventing us from merging the PR.
7. If we do not hear from you after requesting more information within 30 days, the PR will auto-close. In this case, we might elect to open our own PR and re-use some of the changes that you proposed, supplemented with anything else that was required to be added in your original PR.
8. If your PR fixes a problem in the previous **still supported** UE branches, feel free to implement those changes and create additional PRs in those branches as well (make sure to branch off of each individual UE branch). Note, that if a change to any of the previous branches is not trivial and requires a lot of testing and compatibility checks, we might elect to close it if we do not think that it brings enough value to the branch.

### Other ways to contribute

Keep an eye on our repo and stay active on existing issues and PRs - you can help by adding informative comments to the discussions, additional repro steps, repros in different environments, or any suggestions as to what could be causing the issue and how it could be solved.
