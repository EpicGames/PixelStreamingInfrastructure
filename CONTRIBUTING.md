# Welcome to Pixel Streaming contribution guide

First and foremost, thank you for your time and contribution to Pixel Streaming! We are proud and excited to be a part of a community that continuously helps improve Pixel Streaming ðŸŽ‰

If you are not familiar with contributing on GitHub, you can have a look at the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/get-started) that talks about repositories structure, forks, branches, commits, issues, and PRs.

## Code of conduct

Please remain patient, courteous and professional at all times. Any form of spam, abuse or discrimination will not be tolerated.

## Getting started

If you believe that you have found a bug, have suggestions for our documentation, or have a proposal for a feature that could realistically and achievably improve quality of life in various use case scenarios or enhance Pixel Streaming, you can raise it with us by creating a new issue.
1. Search all open and closed issues [here](https://github.com/EpicGames/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) - your issue may have already been discussed or addressed.
2. If your issue appears unique, open a new issue [here](https://github.com/EpicGames/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/issues/new/choose) by selecting a bug or feature request.
3. Make sure to fill in the template as much as possible - any information you can provide, such as repro steps, crash stacks, screenshots, etc. can help us triage and fix the problem as quickly as possible.
4. Keep an eye on your issue - our developers or other users might reach out with requests for more information. If this happens, issues that have not received response in over 30 days will be automatically closed.
5. Be patient while waiting on a resolution - we prioritize the issues internally, and some less critical features (however much we'd love to implement them) will take a backseat to more pressing priorities, so they can take a while to get implemented.

If you want to contribute in other ways, you can look through already opened issues and add comments to help us triage them -  go a long mile.
If a similar issue already exists, feel free to leave comments with any additional helpful information, such as repro steps, crash stacks, screenshots and any other relavent details - this will help us address the issue sooner.
